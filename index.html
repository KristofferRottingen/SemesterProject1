                    <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution.

                        <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It is a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to Wind Island that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.</p>
